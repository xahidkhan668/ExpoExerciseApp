      {
        question: 'What muscles does this exercise target?',
        answer: 'The incline bench press primarily targets the upper chest (clavicular head of the pectoralis major), front deltoids, and triceps.'
      },
      {
        question: "What's the proper incline angle?",
        answer: 'For optimal upper chest activation, set the bench between 30-45 degrees. Going too high (above 45Â°) shifts focus to the front deltoids.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I prevent shoulder pain?',
        answer: 'Keep your elbows at about a 45-degree angle to your torso, not flared out at 90 degrees. This reduces shoulder stress.'
